## My Process

### Built With

- React
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

While working on this project, I deepened my understanding of CSS Grid and responsive design principles. Hereâ€™s an example of a grid layout I implemented:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 1.5rem;
}
```
- This approach ensures a flexible layout that adjusts seamlessly based on the screen size.

## Continued Development
I aim to:

- Further refine my skills in creating complex grid-based layouts.
- Experiment with advanced CSS animations to make interfaces more interactive.
- Improve accessibility by incorporating ARIA roles and testing with screen readers.
